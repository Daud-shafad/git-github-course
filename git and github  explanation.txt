explanation about git


___Git is a tool that is used in almost every software engineering job.
___ if you want to get a job you need to know it and that is why we learned it
___windows powershell is where we write and run the commands of our code in git which is code version control software
___ git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit - this command resets if there is previous/old name and email in commit
of git version.
___so you might have noticed one thing which is big difference between google docs and git is that google docs 
automatically creates versions of your document for you while you create manually in git.
___you might wondering why are we creating manually in git, why we automate this, the problem with code is that until
you finish your code it probably doesn't work so we donot really want to be automatically creating versions of our code
that don't work. and the google docs doesn't matter if the things finished or not. it is just a bunch of words and 
sentences, so you are not going to get errors from a half finished document.
___note: git log command doesnot show unnamed branches.

___you can make shortcuts:  git config --global alias.s "status"  which is same as "git s"
___git config --global alias.cm "commit -m" which is same as "git cm -m"
___ git config --global alias.co "checkout" which is  same as "git co"

___GIT is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for 
coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. it is goals 
include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
___developer: linus torvids, junio c hamano.
___initial release date: april 7 2005
___operating systems: posix (linux, macos, solaris, aix, and windows)
___repository: git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
___stable release: 2.41.0/ 1 june 2023
___written in: primarily in c, with gui and programming scripts written in shell script, perl, tcl, and pythong
___git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files, it is generally used fo source code
management in software development, git is used to tracking changes in the source code, the distributed version conrol
tool is used fo source code management
___git which is (global information tracker) is a powerful and widely-used version control system commonly used for 
software development and other collaboratively projects. the full form of git isjust the beginning of understanding
the powerful capabilities of this tool
___git is not a programming language, but it is become incredibly important for computer programmers working in almost
 any language you can name. today git is the de facto standard for what is known as version control software.
___git is a distributed vcs, a category known as dvcs, more on that later. like many of the most popular vcs systems
available today, git is free and open source.
___git has a database "committed" means that the data is safely stored in your local database, the git directory is where git
stores the meta data and object database for your project. github also provides access to a git database stored on github
via an api, aptly named "git database"




GIT HUB EXPLANATION

___2 WAYS SYNC which is any updates of computer also gets  update on google drive and any updates of google drive also
gets updates on your computer.
___you might be wondering why do we use github? why can't we just put our code into google drive? that will give us an 
online backup and a two-way sync automatically. and to be honest you're right. we could just put our code into google 
drive but just like google docs version history, google drive is not specifically designed for git repositories.
just as a reminder, agit repository is a folder that contains our code, like we have here that is being tracked for 
changes by git. github gives us similar benefits to google drive but it's specifically designed for git repositories.
it has a lot of features that allow us to manage our code and our version history, and that is why we use a specialized
service like github, instead of generic online backup solution like google drive, and icloud. and there is other several
services that do the same thing as github, there is also bitbucket and gitlab. so we learn github, the other two are
similar, the buttons are just in different places.

___when you create a repository in your github account  you have two repositories one is for computer and one for
a online backup. the one for computer is the folder on your desktop and is named local repository, the word
local refers to things our computer, and the other one is online backup repository which is  the one you made in
github account and also is named remote repository the word remote refers to things that are online.
___get remote -v means -v stands for verbose which gives you more details

___so we use git push in both cases, to initially push our code up to github, and also then later on to push new commits
up to github as well.
